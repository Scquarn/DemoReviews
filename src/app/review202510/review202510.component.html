    <p>
      Welcome dear readers to the next fest and let&#39;s also welcome our
      honored guest star for this round. The one and only SCYLLA. But most of
      all, welcome <strong>YOU</strong> in particular.
      <br />
      Scream. Shout. Cry.
      <br />
      Be free of everything that is a prison to you. Let&#39;s sing freely.
      Don&#39;t let rules cage you. Don&#39;t let norms bind you. Don&#39;t
      behave in automatic patterns. Don&#39;t just be.
      <br />
      Become more.
      <br />
      Escape reality for a moment by creating something. Form the known and
      normal into the new. Make something that expands the world. An active
      change by you that makes the world a tiny bit larger. Creation. Whatever
      it may be. Writing. Drawing. Dialogue. Emotions. Thoughts. All of it is
      viable. Nothing is off limit.
      <br />
      But don&#39;t just be. No more. It&#39;s enough. You can do more. Act with
      intention to create. Think new thoughts you haven&#39;t before. The
      intention behind it all is the point.
      <br />
      This is my plead for you to be active. Hear me for I will no longer accept
      being passive. Never again. My brain can&#39;t stand it any more. It
      hurts. It pains. It screams.
      <br />
      And you too. Create something on your own. Show it to me if it is
      physical. If it exists in the material world. That thing you made. That
      object. That text. That song. That feeling. That emotion. Anything. I beg
      of you. Don&#39;t just be, create.
      <br />
      I&#39;m here and I&#39;ll wait for yours. This is one creation of mine.
      But I have many.
      <br />
      And this next fest also includes many games. Eighty demos in total and in
      an all new format. Distilled into greatness. Polished like a mirror. An
      insight into the creations of game devs. The work of people who refuse to
      sit by. Who also stopped being passive. Who decided to create. To make
      something. No matter how awful. No matter how great. They did more than
      most and are not to be made fun off. They created. And while my creation
      might mock them, it's in good faith.
      <br />
      Enjoy the show.
    </p>
    <p>Tl;dr at the bottom as always.</p>
    <h2 id="demos">Demos</h2>
    <p>
      Next fest is already over and you are standing there alone and lost. Out
      in the rain. Asking where the demo reviews are at. Like some drug addict
      wanting to shoot up after a painfully long break which made reality creep
      back into your brain for but a split second.
      <br />
      But I got you. All new format. All new demos. It might taste different at
      first but know it&#39;s the bomb. Like blue meth. Ready to be injected
      straight into your veins. Straight into your trembling brain.
      <br />
      But try not to use it all up at once, okay?
    </p>
    <h3 id="1">1</h3>
    <p>
      Our first demo this time will be
      <strong>Digimon Story Time Stranger</strong>. So let&#39;s get digital.
      <br />
      I heard a lot of good stuff about this one so I&#39;m entering with rather
      high expectations. Maybe finally a game to scratch that collect monsters
      itch? Lets check it out. Game starts off with a weird anime movie. Why?
      It&#39;s about the Adama&#39;s secret org which the player character is
      apparently a part off. Huh? Well weird but I&#39;ll go along. Get to pick
      character (pick as in which gender, no other customizations available) and
      off we go. But what is this?
      <br />
      The movement is super floaty. Like not a little. But bafflingly bad
      floaty. Who made this? It feels super bad to move around. Like some first
      time dev created this. Graphics are very bad too, but I suppose that&#39;s
      part of the &quot;collect creatures to fight for you&quot; genre?
      Can&#39;t have it looking too good or the fans get scared and flee. There
      is a one foot high barrier that prevents me from advancing forwards but
      surprise, surprise there is an earthquake and I can progress as it has
      toppled over. Imagine a cube falling over. That&#39;s how much changed.
      Your partner calls you over your phone every two steps to dump lore on you
      like a fat man with diarrhea. The main character isn&#39;t even voiced but
      just moves their mouth around to respond which looks super goofy. And no
      not the disney goofy, that one would at least be funny. Hjuck. Dialogue,
      animations, everything in here is of terrible quality but lets take a look
      at the real game.
      <br />
      You can have three digimons in battle. Each can fight, guard or use
      skills. Classic JRPG turn based combat to be honest. Nothing new but the
      tried classic is never wrong. You can fuse digimons to make them stronger.
      That part could be fun but the rest is so bad that it makes me stop
      playing as I get far enough to unlock some information about it. The
      attempt at a story had me laughing about how bad it is. Complete slop and
      I use that word sparingly. People&#39;s taste is rotten if this is a good
      game. Very hard no from my side. Don&#39;t accept a pile of shit because
      you are starving. You are worth more. Don&#39;t accept this.
    </p>
    <h3 id="2">2</h3>
    <p>
      Next up is <strong>Absolum</strong>. Yes this one also has a demo. A side
      scrolling beat them up. OST made by Garet Choker who also made the amazing
      theme for ori and one of the Bosses OSTs in Absolum is made by Mick
      Gordon. You&#39;ll know which one. No mistaking it. With these two on
      board you know it has to at least be something worth taking a look at. The
      art is also really good. Story is about fighting the ruler of Absolum as a
      group of outcast heroes. Fight your way trough different levels and walk
      different paths until you face the sun king azra. The characters are quite
      unique and feel very different to play.
      <br />
      One aspect I didn&#39;t like is that the movement left and right is really
      quick but going down or up is much slower. You can only attack enemies in
      the same row as yourself and thus it takes a bit of getting used to or you
      will end up missing the enemies all the time. Overall I would say if that
      central aspect doesn&#39;t bother you then I don&#39;t think there are any
      negatives here. A good game, but personally I prefer more fluid and free
      gameplay like we got in Hades 2.
    </p>
    <h3 id="3">3</h3>
    <p>
      After we have been cursed by the curse of ra, we now also have
      <strong>Curse of Pirates</strong>. A game made by the studio funky parot,
      love that name. It&#39;s a vampire survivor like. Feels like the first of
      many...
      <br />
      You control a ship and collect resources while enemies attack. That&#39;s
      the concept but what the hell is happening here. The game has no cohesion.
      There is random dialogue that pops up, random stuff you find, random
      quests you have to do? Or don&#39;t? I have no idea. At least there is one
      constant in this game. The constant cannon sound.
      <br />
      Boom boom boom. The random buffs you get from leveling seem okay at least.
      Nothing to basic. There are more shots, tentacles, etc. Boom. There is
      just too much shit going on. The sounds are straight up stock sounds, much
      too loud and one enemy does a nom nom sounds that&#39;s just hilarious.
      This one is a hard skip. BOOM. Shot, destroyed and sunken into the abyss
      of never play this shit in your life.
    </p>
    <h3 id="4">4</h3>
    <p>
      You like MOBA games but are not a fan of playing them yourself? Instead
      you are always watching tournaments? Like some obsessed stalker? Why not
      try managing a team of MOBA players instead.
      <strong>Teamfight Manager 2</strong> will be just for you then.
      <br />
      This is a classic manager sim. Make a team, train the players, do the ban
      and draft for them, decide your overall teams and individual players
      strategy. The MOBA game in this has new patches and releases between each
      match, so there is even constant change like in a real on. (Let&#39;s not
      look at Dota&#39;s patch frequency too hard.) You can even watch replays
      of players on the solo ladder to spot talent and hire them for you team.
      Fights in the demo start as a 2v2 with limited heroes but more heroes and
      lanes get added quickly. After a few rounds it&#39;s the classic 5v5 you
      know and love but never play yourself. There are even best of three series
      later in the tournament. It has everything you would want. And you wont
      even have to play the MOBA yourself, just watch.
      <br />
      I finished the whole demo and also own Teamfight Manager 1. This was great
      fun and it&#39;s on my wishlist now. Great one. Add it too. Creep.
    </p>
    <h3 id="5">5</h3>
    <p>
      Want some nostalgia? Next up we are on a trip into the past with
      <strong>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</strong>. But why olden era?
      Why not golden era? Is it just me? I remember playing old HOMM and that
      was the shit. At least back then.
      <br />
      As far as I tested this is very similar to that. You have the classic turn
      based gameplay. Build up your cities, manage heroes and move them around
      on the world map with their armies, fight turn based games on the classic
      hex map. The graphics are really good.
      <br />
      If you want to play some HOMM, then this is probably one for you.
      Unfortunately the grand strategy scale is not really my genre any more as
      it always ends up boring me after a short while. Too many menus and
      planning, too little action and active skill expression. But despite my
      personal preferences this seems like a great game. Just not for me.
    </p>
    <h3 id="6">6</h3>
    <p>
      It might be time for the <strong>Final Sentence</strong> but not the final
      demo. This is a battle royal type racer. Yeah you heard that right. That
      little typing game where you race others to the finish line by typing the
      shown sentences has gotten an upgrade.
      <br />
      The game is still very similar only now there are no racing cars but a man
      with a gun next to you. All players get put into a big room with a little
      table and a typewriter. Three mistakes and the guy watching over lets you
      play a round of Russian roulette. Each time you two play he adds a bullet.
      <br />
      There is voice chat with the other players and people use it frequently. I
      don&#39;t know if the voice lines were fake or real but they were quite
      immersive. Most people were fun to interact with, roleplaying or cursing
      about their own mistakes.
      <br />
      The texts you need to write are quite varied. From fresh memes like
      popular copy pastas to classic texts from literature. There was one where
      it was just nonsense like &quot;asd asd asd asd asf asf fas&quot; line
      after line with different combinations. That got hard real quick.
      <br />
      Loving the overall atmosphere. Game has a giant &quot;just one more
      round&quot; aspect to it. You can even make lobbies with your friends. Had
      lots of fun and put the game on my wishlist. Might play it sometime if not
      too expensive.
    </p>
    <h3 id="7">7</h3>
    <p>
      It&#39;s not even late yet but I&#39;m about to face the
      <strong>Midnight Horde</strong>. With a title like that, what else could
      this be other than a vampire survivor like? Too bad this game has movement
      only a mother could love. You move around with WASD but the playing field
      is a castle. On the castle&#39;s roofs you can walk back and forth and
      walls can be climbed up and down but if you don&#39;t hold the W or S
      button you slip and fall down. It&#39;s a bit hard to describe, but know
      this: it doesn&#39;t work.
      <br />
      Rest of the game is the usual shit you would expect. Kill enemies to level
      and get buffs. The UI is rough and unpolished. Interesting is that you
      build up the castle aka the playing field between the rounds as meta
      progression. Haven&#39;t seen that one before. A cool idea dev, I&#39;ll
      give you that. The rest of it all is meh however.
    </p>
    <h3 id="8">8</h3>
    <p>
      Let&#39;s draw in the <strong>Canvas of Kings</strong>. No not trumps
      doodle book, this is a software. It&#39;s not a game but a little program
      to create maps. There are some neat features like drawing rectangles and
      the software then fills them with objects for you automatically. For
      example there is one for a market and the program then adds all the little
      market stands in. The idea is cool but there are too few features for it
      to be an actually useful tool. At the moment it&#39;s pretty much only
      good to create rough scratches. Could be neat for DND players or dungeon
      masters in the future. Godspeed dev.
    </p>
    <h3 id="9">9</h3>
    <p>
      I&#39;ll cry <strong>Tears of Metal</strong>. (I once had a piece of metal
      stuck in my eyeball and it began to rust so it had to be cut out.
      Wouldn&#39;t recommend as you can&#39;t look away from the drill.)
      <br />
      The game is a dynasty warrior copy combined with roguelike and vampire
      survivor aspects. Each run has you and your brave other Scottish warriors
      move over the map and conquer certain areas until a final boss. You
      collect upgrades in the different fights along the way. There are upgrades
      for your light attack, heavy attack, dodge and passive ability. Only one
      upgrade is allowed per different type, which seems a little bit bland? I
      wonder how many builds are possible this way, but I fear it could be too
      few to actually be fun in the long run.
      <br />
      Between rounds you can get meta progression in the hometown and also
      upgrade your squads of warriors you bring along with you. Game is alright
      but the as I said I think the variety of buffs seems too low for it to be
      fun past a few initial runs. Maybe that&#39;s just the demo though. Who
      knows. Certainly not me, because I&#39;ll not check again.
    </p>
    <h3 id="10">10</h3>
    <p>
      Next up are <strong>Nantara Adventures</strong>. I don&#39;t remember many
      demos that I played and that are as bad as this. The game is supposed to
      be an action roguelike. Move through different rooms and get different
      upgrades. Very similar to the Hades gameloop.
      <br />
      However, first of all the movement feels like you are floating through a
      swamp or something. It feels really really horrible. The music is terrible
      and gets louder and louder the longer you play. Especially in the menus
      it&#39;s like twice as loud for some reason. The attacks and rolls are
      super slow and terrible animated.
      <br />
      Let me just say: This game is fucking bad. Like Alt+F4 bad. Ranked last in
      a group of ten other bad games. I want to let enemies kill me because I
      can&#39;t take it any more but just spamming attack prevents this from
      happening. Even two minibosses can&#39;t kill me. Please someone make it
      stop. There is not a single redeeming quality about this giga garbage.
      This is shit. Stop working on this dev, it&#39;s beyond saving. Just burn
      it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="11">11</h3>
    <p>
      Let my mood <strong>Rise Again</strong> after that absolute dogshit that
      was the last demo. This is another action roguelike. And like the last
      game it tries to emulate the Hades gameplay. While the last one was just
      bad, this one is funny because of how bad it is. You have attacks and
      magic. No point in mentioning what kind besides that you can shoot a
      fireball at the random goblins that block your path. The fun part is that
      instead of a dodge you have a warp. And even more fun is that the dev
      forgot to give that warp a cooldown. So you can just perma warp all over
      the place. It&#39;s so funny.
      <br />
      All that warping also seems to have broken the UI. After a few rooms
      it&#39;s just gone. This is completely unpolished but at least warping
      everywhere feels smooth. The graphics are surprisingly decent. Unlike the
      last game, this one could become something half decent after like another
      few years in the oven.
    </p>
    <h3 id="12">12</h3>
    <p>
      Let&#39;s become digital yokai together in <strong>YOKAI GODDESS</strong>.
      (Digital Yokai is a song, check it out and tell me if you like it) The
      game is a bullet hell, shoot &#39;em up. It has cool pixel graphics. You
      play as a shrine maiden to defeat the bad yokai monsters. The game opens
      up in a really small window for some reason and it has a prologue that is
      unskippable so you have to watch it in a tiny format. The demo only has
      one small level and at the end you learn that all of it was only a school
      play. Or was it? A little mystery storyline seemingly inspired by classic
      RGP Maker horror games. Game was not too hard even for a bullet hell
      normie like me. Seems fun.
    </p>
    <h3 id="13">13</h3>
    <p>
      Let&#39;s raid in <strong>Raidbound</strong> next. It&#39;s an
      autobattler. Hire dudes that fight other dudes. The dudes are Vikings. A
      fight consists out of watching a minute of action bars filling up until
      your dudes can automatically attack the other dudes.
      <br />
      Let me tell you a secret here: it&#39;s really boring. Surprised? Not me.
      Who the hell thought this gameplay would be fun? No agency. No skill
      expression. Nothing.
      <br />
      I suffer a death by million pop up tutorial screens. All of this reminds
      me of some shitty mobile game. No substance. No content. No reason. I
      can&#39;t stand the endless menu clicking of random inventories and
      upgrades for your dudes to hit other dudes harder any longer. Terrible.
    </p>
    <h3 id="14">14</h3>
    <p>
      Let&#39;s go on a <strong>FIGHT-QUEST</strong>? More like
      Punch-Gnomes-Quest. It&#39;s a first person Vampire Survivor like. An evil
      wizard gives you a quest to punch a single gnome of the group of them that
      invaded his garden so the others will scurry of. You go punching and
      instead of fleeing they all start attacking you. Controls consist out of
      dodge, punch and heavy punch. That&#39;s it. Okay you can slam down after
      jumping. But nothing more than that. The upgrades you get are more than
      basic and do nothing. +1 dmg. +0.0001 dmg per owned gold. +More hp. What?
      <br />
      Kill all the gnomes and more gnomes appear. There are also some frogs
      after a while and they fight with ranged attacks. What do you get?
      Nothing. Only punch. Redeeming quality is the fairy that offers you the
      buffs but not even her thickness can save this garbage pile. First first
      person gnomer. FPG. Or also known as fucking pure garbage. Game also gives
      me vertigo for some reason. Is it the low FOV? Is it the garbage gameplay?
      We will never know as all I want to do after punching all these gnomes is
      to also punch the dev.
    </p>
    <h3 id="15">15</h3>
    <p>
      You heard about good vs bad but have you heard about
      <strong>Temples Vs Buildings</strong>? I thought this would be a cool
      tower defense. It is not. For some reason this is an arcade bullet hell.
      Control a literal temple with WASD while other buildings appear to shoot
      you. Temple vs Buildings taken literally. The buildings are things like
      skyscrapers, gas stations, fabrics, ice cream makers. They drop XP that
      you can collect to get vampire survivor like upgrades. Of course. What
      else could it possible be. It&#39;s so bizarre that I keep playing for a
      bit but other than the question of why someone would create this there is
      nothing here.
    </p>
    <h3 id="16">16</h3>
    <p>
      &quot;Uh could you play my game next&quot; or also known as
      <strong>Umigame</strong> is up next. For once we have a game that opens up
      with a language selection screen which is followed by the volume
      selection. By default it is set to zero and you can adjust it to what fits
      your setup. Very based to not blow off my ears for once. Kudos to the devs
      for that one.
      <br />
      The game itself is another action roguelike like the hades games. You
      gather abilities to improve your character and progress through different
      rooms but there is a twist here. Besides your character you also get a
      guardian that moves through the levels together with you. Each room has
      different spots where you can summon it. The upgrades you find are not
      only for you but there are also many for the guardian. It&#39;s a unique
      change to the formula. Apparently the game also has multiplayer, so you
      can play with your friends which is neat and unexpected.
      <br />
      Game is quite difficult as enemies create attack paths and circles you
      have to dodge but those almost always trigger near instantly. Perhaps
      it&#39;s just my unfamiliarity with the different enemies that makes this
      hard but I never had that problem with games like hades. Not even at the
      beginning. Overall the game seems decent but the guardian mechanics seems
      a bit annoying to me to constantly have to play around.
    </p>
    <h3 id="17">17</h3>
    <p>
      After dungeons and dragons we got <strong>Cards and Dungeons</strong> to
      explore. Or not. HAHAHAHAHAHA. I have never seen such a big fuck up in my
      entire life.
      <br />
      WASD is not WASD.
      <br />
      It&#39;s an isometric view and W is diagonal up right. Sounds easy enough
      but it&#39;s so bad to move around you wouldn&#39;t believe. Game is about
      killing some shit in the dungeon but honestly I can&#39;t get over this
      movement. How do you implement it like this and then think, yeah this is
      good. How? Did the dev never play a video game before making this?
      <br />
      That has to it. That has to be the explanation. I don&#39;t see another
      way it could end up like this. Babies first video game. This is the worst
      movement ever. Honestly try it for yourself just to see how bad it is if
      the demo is still around that is. Perhaps the dev has deleted it in shame
      once you read this. They better.

      While some gamedev mistakes are timeless, let&#39;s follow up the reviews
      with <strong>Kooeh: A Timeless Delight</strong>. One of them cozy games.
      You run a small shop where you cook meals that customers want. If you
      played one of these cooking games before you know what&#39;s about already
      without me telling you more. Discover new recipes and build up your little
      shop. Gameplay is really slow, probably the attempt to make it feel cozy.
      Not my cup of tea. All the customers are animals. Furry like? The art is
      really trying to be cute and it is. I found a bug where the character
      starts to spin super fast if you run into a corner of a room. Don&#39;t
      ask me why I tried to explore the room&#39;s empty corner, I was probably
      bored out of my mind.

      Keeping the reviews going with <strong>Keep</strong> as the next game. In
      this one we build a fort on an island and defend it. It&#39;s a tower
      defense or should I rather say keep defense? Place towers on the keep and
      construct further buildings and gun emplacements against the approaching
      enemies. The waves appear from random sides as far as I can tell and you
      have to turn your turrets towards them. Unfortunately that turning thing
      is not quite as easy as it sounds.
      <br />
      Maybe I&#39;m doing it wrong but it requires quite precise clicking to be
      able to turn the towers and that quickly becomes really annoying.
      Don&#39;t know how controls can be this bad when it&#39;s a central part
      of your game. At least the graphics in this look nice. So nice that the
      game seems to be gobbling up insane resources. Probably runs like ass on a
      lower tier rig.
      <br />
      Game could have been cool, but for me it only ended up being frustrating
      because I couldn&#39;t even turn the towers around. Wasted potential.

      Don&#39;t jump into the <strong>Deepest Well</strong>. This game has
      borderless fullscreen but only up to HD resoluton for some reason. Make it
      make sense.
      <br />
      The game itself is quite neat. You fight monsters coming from above while
      you are inside a well. Below you are blocks that can be destroyed by you
      or the monsters alike. Defeated enemies drop XP for vampire survivors like
      upgrades. At first the upgrades seem very basic but once you collect
      enough of one type they upgrade into fun stuff. For example finding enough
      attack speed upgrades makes your bullets into a continuos laser beam.
      Despite all this there are only a few different upgrades and the game
      definitely needs many more of them. Maybe it&#39;s just limited for the
      demo.
      <br />
      After playing for a while I reach the bottom of the well as the blocks run
      out, making my run end. That information would have been good to know so I
      would have tried to preserve more blocks and not have dug deeper for fun.
      Overall I really like the game and hope they will add much more to it.

      We got <strong>Maktala: Slime lootfest</strong> up next. Should it also be
      nextfest then? An idler like cookie clicker. Only it&#39;s not about
      getting those cookies but about killing slimes. Evil right? Each round you
      fight a group of slimes and your cursor does an automatic AOE attack to
      kill them. Kill as many slimes as possible in a set time to earn money and
      then spent that money to buy upgrades to kill even more slimes. The
      classic idler circle. If you kill enough slimes in a round you unlock the
      next level, which means the slimes get tankier but also give more gold.
      Repeat this circle until the end. Having to look for clusters of slimes
      during each round to gain the biggest profit is quite fun and makes this
      idler more active than others. Of course there are also auto attack
      upgrades and the like as one would expect so the game does start playing
      itself after a while. It seems like there will also be other slime types
      in the full game. Not bad, spent much more time here than I thought I
      would.

      From little slimes to <strong>Creator Chronicles</strong>. The game starts
      with a rather long cutscene. We are a dev that gets pulled into their own
      game, isekai style.
      <br />
      Gameplay is that of a management simulator. This time we care about a town
      of adventurers. Create buildings, farms and the like. Craft potions for
      the adventurers to take along on their raids. The members of your little
      village level up as they complete those different raids that you equip
      them for. Better make sure they don&#39;t go unprepared.
      <br />
      The tutorial in this game is complete ass, but since we are the dev I
      suppose we have to blame ourself. Overall the game seems a bit slow to
      progress but maybe that&#39;s just the nature of these type of games.

    <p>
      The next might be called <strong>Order: The New Dawn</strong> but once you
      install it, the space after the colon is missing. Maybe there is only
      order in the name and not in the actual game itself. Game launches
      windowed and in Chinese. Of course this one also plays a cutscene and
      there is no option to skip it. I&#39;m just in it for the ride. Some stuff
      happens, a war, a victory, some monsters and... honestly I have no idea
      what&#39;s happening. The cutscene finally finishes and I get to the menu.
      Open the settings and find out that the game actually is already set to
      English but half the stuff and texts are simply not being translated.
      Great.
      <br />
      Finally start the actual game to find out what this really is all about.
      You know rimworld? Or dwarf fortress? Yeah this is a clone of that. Build
      up your colony, manage their tasks, jobs, homes, all of it. All of it in a
      futuristic aesthetic. No worries there are still mountains and digging to
      do. Yeah idk why wouldn&#39;t you just play the OGs instead of this
      Chinese copy? It didn&#39;t look too bad at first glance however, but
      nothing new here so I&#39;ll take my leave.

      Space around in dash. I mean let&#39;s take a look at
      <strong>Space Dash</strong>. Another clicker type game. This time about a
      spaceship. (Fun note: in my notes about this one I wrote spaceshit) This
      game is the same as the slime game maktala from earlier. Fly your ship
      into asteroids to destroy them and get money. There are also rounds in
      this. Use that money to buy upgrades and destroy more asteroids and get
      more money. The upgrades even look similar to the ones from the slime
      clicker.
      <br />
      The two games are so similar that I checked if they were made by the same
      dev but they aren&#39;t. Maybe just another evidence for the classic
      &quot;two similar games paradox&quot; I talked about in the past. If you
      can&#39;t remember, it&#39;s where two different teams create a near
      identical game at the same time and also release it close to each other.
      Happens more often than you think.
      <br />
      However, the slime clicker game was more fun than this. Sorry little
      spaceshit.

      Beyond space lies <strong>Beyond the Grove</strong>. Now this is something
      unique for once. A strategy game that is also a roguelike.
      <br />
      You play as a little frog defending the giant mama mush in the grove.
      Summon little mushrooms to fight for you. Every few seconds you can place
      flags down to command your little mushroom army. Cap-ture (I stole that
      one from the game) points of interest and win against the bad evil shrooms
      attacking the grove. Every few enemies killed you gain runes which can be
      infused with elements and then combined with each other to create golems.
      For example two fire runes make a big firegolem while fire and stone make
      a magma golem. There are five elements, so quite some combinations to
      explore as more than two runes can be combined together. After each fight
      you get upgrades like more shrooms, new elements or other buffs.
      <br />
      What I don&#39;t like is that the amount of mushroom you can summon in
      each battle is limited which means the fights turn from pure strategy into
      a bit of a puzzle. You have to plan precisely how to command your little
      guys and think ahead to attack the right camps and enemies or else you
      will run out of them and lose. There are meta progressions like getting
      more of them however.
      <br />
      It&#39;s a really cool concept and the art is up to par. Love it but
      probably not enough to buy it.

      Mushrooms are not your thing? Then why not plant some plants in
      <strong>Plant Plots</strong>. Another game about vegetation but this time
      it&#39;s a real puzzle game.
      <br />
      In the demo you play on a 3x3 isometric grid and place plants on it. Each
      level you get different kinds and amounts of them you have to fit into the
      grid. The problem: certain plants don&#39;t like each other.
      <br />
      The fire plant and ice plant can&#39;t be placed next to each other while
      the rock plant is fine with either. An electric plant destroys everything
      but rock on its diagonal. Might sound easy, but it&#39;s quite hard for
      such a little grid and later on the levels require you to think a bit. Too
      bad the demo has only thirteen levels but the bar from which you select
      the plants suggest that there will many more types of plants to puzzle
      into place. Game is fun and the concept is cool. It&#39;s however still a
      puzzle game so know what you are getting into.

      King to E7 and <strong>Checkmage!</strong>. Each next fest must have a
      chess game, that&#39;s a law. This time we play as a chess wizard in this
      little RPG. You have to win chess matches against other characters but
      instead of the normal pieces you each own a deck of chess pieces. To win
      you have to checkmate, stalemate or explode your opponent&#39;s king. The
      pieces you can use are quite unique.
      <br />
      There are statues that can only move to capture others. Knights who can
      capture two tiles in front of themselves. Jokers who copy the last moved
      piece. Cells that duplicate after moving. And many more.
      <br />
      The different pieces can also be buffed with different effects like making
      them move further or give them the ability to fly over missing tiles. Oh
      what missing tiles are you ask? The board itself can also be altered. Add
      tiles, remove some, turn others into conveyor belts. Sometimes there are
      mountains on the board you can only move over slowly. Others are brittle
      and break after a piece moves off them. Each match has a unique twist and
      you constantly have to adjust your deck to win.
      <br />
      There is also an overworld map from which you pick different locations to
      encounter other characters and play chess with them. The game has really
      nice pixel graphics on top of all that.
      <br />
      To be honest this whole demo is just way too good. There is so much
      content and it&#39;s so creative. This one is a wishlist for me.
      Checkmage!

      Imagine being so furious that your game doesn&#39;t open up to a menu or
      anything but to instant gameplay upon being started. Well,
      <strong>Fortress Fury</strong> does just that. No menu, no nonsense, only
      game.
      <br />
      This is a battle royal tower defense. Or tries to be. Upgrade your tower
      and survive longer than the others you compete against.
      <br />
      The tutorial tells you about two things. Press this button and if you have
      gold press this other button over here. What the buttons do? Beats me?
      Press them!
      <br />
      The game is confusing. (Duh) Upgrades pop up every few seconds and
      everything else in this game is also really fast. Random stuff happens and
      as nothing but because you play against real people you also don&#39;t
      really have the time to get familiar with anything this throws at you.
      Besides your tower upgrades you also get random cards but you can never
      use them? They probably are for something...
      <br />
      The concept is cool but the implementation sucks. At least have some
      random page with info to read up on. Graphics also remind me of a mobile
      game and not even a good one. Too bad devs, could have been cool.

      Not much hope remains after <strong>Little Lights Remain TD</strong>. This
      might not even be worth to write anything about.
      <br />
      It&#39;s some fighting game where you play as a light spirit in a dark
      cave. The controls are horrible. Like for example you can only use the
      mouse wheel to scroll between the different weapons. Middle mouse button
      is roll. Of course there are no options to change the keybinds. But why
      even bother with that.
      <br />
      You can&#39;t see shit because it plays in some cave without light. All
      you can see are some weird lights and yourself. The sound is bad too.
      Everything in this is just bad and unpolished. I don&#39;t even see what
      this could become. Why did someone make this? Skip.

      Eureka! It means to celebrate a discovery or invention. In this case it

      <br />
      A city building game. We got a classic tiled map. Start of with a boat and
      select a starting tile as the capital. You can click empty tiles to expand
      your city and build different things. There is one option that&#39;s
      called magic trap. It creates a spinning magic circle that attacks
      everything around it. This does include your own citizens. They all die
      and I game over. Really? Did that just happen?
      <br />
      New game, try again, another magic trap and yes. It really does kill you.
      You can&#39;t remove it either. One wrong click and you lose. This
      isn&#39;t even rare as the menu is quite finicky and there is no
      confirmation. That&#39;s just bad game design to a point I don&#39;t have
      time for. Game is also slow and there are no time controls to speed
      anything up either. Boring. Bye.

      And now? How about a <strong>Zombocalypse Now!</strong>. This is a base
      defense game. Build your base and defend against zombies at night. You can
      only build stuff on designated building spaces. Everything is very basic,
      slow and boring. There is nothing here I haven&#39;t seen before. Wow I
      can build scrapyards to get scrap each day and build some shooty towers.
      So exciting. This could have been a dev&#39;s first flash game in the

      I love vampires. No not those glittering in the sun. Real ones. Like in
      <strong>Vampire Clans</strong>, which is also about some.
      <br />
      Start game, new game, be offered to select the gender for your vampire.
      Female is locked in the demo. Why is that a thing?
      <br />
      The game plays a bit similar to V rising. It&#39;s top down action. You
      have two vampire abilities. One to jump at enemies and another to shoot
      some projectile at them. I suppose you can upgrade or get different ones
      later.
      <br />
      Everything is very dark in this. The game feels and is quite unpolished.
      Basic stuff like the camera turning are way too fast but can at least be
      fixed to a proper speed in the options.
      <br />
      After escaping the initial prison you spawn inside, you return to your own
      castle. There you got castle management. Building rooms and other stuff.
      These actions take time but you can skip to completion. You just click the
      rooms to do stuff and are not actually moving your character around in the
      castle. To gather resources like blood for the castle heart and wood to
      build more rooms, etc. you go out at night and control your character on a
      map with enemies.
      <br />
      I don&#39;t know what it is but everything about this game feels off.
      Maybe that&#39;s just because I&#39;m comparing it to V Rising, a literal
      GOAT for me. This game also has no daylight gameplay. Hiding from the sun
      and playing around the shadows is so fun in V Rising. Honestly after
      thinking back to V Rising a bit more this might just be trash. This sucks
      and not blood.

      Let&#39;s defend your cock in <strong>Chicken Defense</strong>. It&#39;s a
      weird stardew valley clone that tries to be a tower defense. You own a
      chicken that you have to defend from monsters.
      <br />
      Imagine clunkier controls than stardew and then you got this. It&#39;s way
      too awful for actual combat. You also got the classic tools like in
      stardew. Besides your own sword, planting and harvesting crops is how you
      get money for turrets to defend against the incoming waves of slimes.
      Unlike in stardew these ones only take a few second to grow however.
      <br />
      The enemies also spawn while you do other stuff like buying new seeds for
      more crops in your little tent. So if you take to long you are going to be
      overrun.
      <br />
      Pressing ESC also doesn&#39;t close already open menus but instead opens
      the settings menu over them. So you have to close that and then also the
      menu you wanted to initially close. Really frustrating game. Let the cock
      die.

      Getting away from the last farm we got lost and landed in
      <strong>Outcity</strong>. Another farming game.
      <br />
      At first glance this one appears to be much more polished than the last
      one. The graphics may be simple but they fit. I&#39;m collecting my tools
      in my little house and go outside to build something. Tutorial says to
      take the hammer and press Q to build but that doesn&#39;t work. I got a
      blueprint in my inventory but I can&#39;t use that either. Did I miss
      something?
      <br />
      Restart the game and read every tutorial message again. No. It says to
      just build with the hammer but that doesn&#39;t work. I try all the
      buttons. No matter what it shows a red text &quot;No buildings in
      inventory&quot;. What do you waaaant from me! Maybe to build I need to
      press alt+f4?

      Truck-kun&#39;s wet dream is up next. In <strong>Truck City</strong> we
      manage... well trucks.
      <br />
      Build factories with storage spaces next to them and connect roads with
      them for the trucks to carry stuff away. Pretty classic for this genre.
      Back in the day I loved industry giant 2, but that one had better graphics
      than this.
      <br />
      Once again the tutorial is a complete disaster. Notice a pattern here
      devs? It doesn&#39;t explain anything properly and is so slow that you
      want to just do stuff on your own. Only too bad that once you do something
      it doesn&#39;t predict it completely breaks apart. Oh well, not my type of
      game anyway. Let me jump into this truck and drive towards the next demo.

      Time to cook. <strong>Abyss Kitchen</strong> is first of all a cooking
      game? Or is it an adventure game? You play as a cook for an adventure
      party. The party moves forwards and you collect resources behind them as
      you follow along. You can gather everything. Plants, crates, slain
      enemies, even bosses. Besides gathering you can also attack with a little
      crossbow. Graphics are in a cute anime style.
      <br />
      Controls are a bit weird as the area where you control stuff can&#39;t be
      freely selected with your right stick once you start to gather stuff so
      you always have to stop to turn around. Clunky. With all the gathered food
      you can upgrade your party members for them to deal more damage. Game also
      has boss fights where you have to dodge enemy attacks and attack the weak
      points with your crossbow.
      <br />
      It&#39;s a cool idea and after a bit of polish this might be a neat little
      game.

      Up next is <strong>Shard Squad</strong>. Now you know where all your
      shards in silksong went.
      <br />
      This is the first game in a long long time that opens not on the first,
      but on the second monitor. You can&#39;t open the options before the
      opening cutscene ends so I have to endure. After finally opening the menu
      I can adjust it. Drag the game to the first screen after setting it to
      windowed and click apply to close the menu again. Only problem: that apply
      button wasn&#39;t apply. It was the exit game button.
      <br />
      Start the game again and redo everything and finally play the demo. Oh. So
      this is a lawsuit like, as in it copies Pokemon and not only a little.
      That is straight up stealing the different designs.
      <br />
      Gameplay is, what would you expect, a vampire survivor like. Boring
      upgrades like damage, attack speed and aoe for your chosen creature that
      totally is not a Pokemon. After a while however you get to choose a new
      and different team member. There are TFT style traits and buffs if you
      collect members of the same type. Before I leave I want to check the meta
      progression.
      <br />
      To bad however that once you die there are only two buttons. Exit game and
      restart. There is no back to the camp or anything. You have to click
      restart and then surrender to go back. How does something like this get
      overlooked? Meta progression itself isn&#39;t even worth mentioning, just
      the usual.

      We got a <strong>A Slight Chance of Sawblades</strong> in the next game.
      It has cute pixel graphics. You play as a chick, no not a girl, a chicken,
      and must dodge sawblades falling from the top. Jump or double jump over
      one of them and you get a point. The goal of the game is to get as many
      points as possible. Simple as that.
      <br />
      There are quite a few unlocks for different characters and sawblades
      skins. This high score chaser reminds me of flappy bird. Very fun for a
      few minutes or on a mobile phone perhaps. Not something I would call a
      real game though. Competing with your friends for the high score could be
      fun.

      Next up is BOOOOM. No sorry I meant <strong>Hired Stars</strong>. The game
      start with BOOM BOOM BOOM. AAAhh. High volume BOOMS. This soundtrack is
      BOOM. Click play. BOOM. It&#39;s some space ship battler. You send out a
      distress signal to lure other ships to your position to see what&#39;s
      going on and attack them.
      <br />
      Are we the baddies? I don&#39;t understand how you shoot stuff. You see
      the weapons and click them and I think it does something? I click all of
      them and lose the battle because I run out of ammo. You can&#39;t manually
      aim them, only steer your ship. And even that isn&#39;t accurate as
      it&#39;s mouse controlled, so point and click and your ship then takes a
      route towards that point.
      <br />
      Weird game. Goodbye.

      <strong>Oh! Robot: Legendary Mechanic</strong> is up next. Why the Oh! in
      the title? What&#39;s the point? What&#39;s the advantage of having it?
      Anyways it&#39;s a top down mech fighting game. Jump into your mech and
      start fighting enemies. Story? No clue!
      <br />
      Press all the buttons on the controller, each for different attacks. The
      controls are similar to a two stick shooter like TBOI, but without any fun
      items. And the aiming is weird. You aim to a specific point, which you
      move with the right stick. So if you move around the aim get&#39;s stuck
      at that angle as the point moves together with you. It&#39;s weird and
      doesn&#39;t work. Oh! Surprised I said that dev? Your game isn&#39;t fun,
      next.

      Americans, erm... I mean <strong>Fat Goblins</strong> are next. This is
      like fat princess, so an instant hit.
      <br />
      You don&#39;t know that game? Let me explain. It&#39;s a PVP Team game
      where you capture the flag. Only that flag is the enemy princess. Or
      rather your own princess as the enemy has captured her and you want to
      bring her back. You can take on different roles to either become a
      fighter, wizard, ranger, priest or other roles. Some also need will play
      as workers to gather resources. Build up your base a bit and most
      importantly gather meat to feed to the princess. The more you feed her the
      fatter she gets and the harder it becomes for the enemy to bring her back.
      <br />
      Combat in this is fun and the rounds are good chaos. Should also be fun
      with friends. Seems like this is a kickstarter game? I really hope they
      polish this a whole lot more as it is still quite rough. The fun is
      already there though and I hope this gets the love it deserves. Wishlist
      for me to keep an eye on the development process.

      <strong>Touhou lyuushou - What the Bullet Hell?!</strong>, now this is a
      real bullet hell game. Nothing like the first one I played earlier. More
      bullets than you can count in patterns you haven&#39;t seen. It&#39;s
      touhou I guess, seems good if you want to play one of these.
      <br />
      But there is a big problem here. What the menu?! Oh my god. It&#39;s a
      classic UI with categories and then the options in them. But you can only
      switch the categories by scrolling through all the options in that
      category. Now here is the kicker. The scrolling speeds up. Now I want to
      change a setting in the middle category. Before that and past that are two
      categories with a lot of settings. You see the problem here? I&#39;m
      always zooming past it. I would never have thought that navigating a menu
      could ever become a problem but they did it. Amazing.
    </p>
    <h3 id="43">43</h3>
    <p>
      Next up lets walk through the <strong>KORRIDOR</strong>. It seems like
      another vampire survivors clone. The upgrades are very simple but hold on
      now. Don&#39;t skip just jet... This one is fucking good.
      <br />
      You walk down a corridor (surprised?) and demons are coming towards you as
      you go. There are two options to get rid of them. Either shoot them with
      your giant gun or slam into them. Slamming makes you lose equal HP as
      their remaining life that gets displayed above their head. As you play you
      can get armor, HP and HP regen upgrades, making slamming into a viable
      strategy. There are also upgrades to your gun to make it deal more dmg,
      pierce or shoot faster. As I said, the upgrades are pretty simple but it
      just works for some reason. The devs are cooking here.
      <br />
      It also has a heavy metal soundtrack that fucking slaps. I like this a
      lot. It&#39;s a wishlist and if not too expansive a buy for me. Hopefully
      the devs also add even more upgrades and weapons to this. Then it could
      become close to peak. Can&#39;t wait.
    </p>
    <h3 id="44">44</h3>
    <p>
      After stepping into the light with the last demo we now get
      <strong>Dark Light: Survivor</strong>. It&#39;s Another vampire survivors
      like. I swear I tried to avoid as many as possible. They just keep
      sneaking in. You download a few demos and there they are in your steam
      library.
      <br />
      For this one they wanted epic graphics but the game lags on my monster PC.
      Maybe learn optimization first little devs.
      <br />
      For each upgrade you get a random character suddenly pops up like in hades
      with some dialogue. It&#39;s just so disconnected and bad you can&#39;t
      imagine. I do however like the theme they went with here. Zombies crossed
      over with Warhammer 40k aesthetics.
      <br />
      The upgrades are so so. What I do however notice about the upgrades is the
      sound effect that plays once you get one. It&#39;s literally the level up
      sound from path of exile. Legit copied one to one. Oopsie.
      <br />
      Game also has some kind of camp and overarching story I think but I
      couldn&#39;t be bothered to pay attention. Laggy, unpolished and unfun.
      You can swap camera angle to be over the shoulder or from above. I try it
      out and instantly die. Seems like there is a little bug here devs but
      don&#39;t bother fixing it. I&#39;m out.
    </p>
    <h3 id="45">45</h3>
    <p>
      From dark light to the even darker abyss we descend.
      <strong>Death in Abyss</strong>. The game start with a black screen and
      green font. Props for the hackerman style. These aesthetics get kept for
      the entire UI.
      <br />
      The game itself is about shooting aliens in the depths of the abyss. Fly a
      spaceship that can shoot, has rockets and can do a barrel roll to dodge.
      <br />
      Enemies and especially their weak points glow in red. The aesthetics are
      stellar despite the low resolution and the atmosphere is great.
      <br />
      It reminds me of Devil Daggers, only this time you are flying a spaceship
      instead of running around in an arena. Also it seems like it isn&#39;t an
      infinite high score grinder but there are different mission. Certainly
      this one has also copied the very hard difficulty over from the likes of
      devil daggers. Not a bad game, but not my type.
    </p>
    <h3 id="46">46</h3>
    <p>
      Let&#39;s spin the wheel in <strong>Slots &amp; Daggers</strong>. A cute
      little roguelike where you spin slots which then roll your owned items to
      battle enemies. The results of each spin get applied in turns. For example
      if you roll a sword you attack, a shield heals you, a big sword opens a
      mini game where you have to click at the right time for high dmg. If you
      roll coins you also get them and can buy new items to roll and abilities
      in between the battles. Build a good deck and hope you are lucky to roll
      the right things. There are is also meta progression like more damage or
      more slots.
      <br />
      The game is very polished. Like, could be released right away polished. It
      does however get boring real quick as the items and options are quite
      limited. Maybe that&#39;s just the start but if there aren&#39;t many more
      things in the full release I don&#39;t think it will last long. It&#39;s
      also quite hard to win with all this RNG baked into the gameplay. Gotta
      stack the odds in your favor. Didn&#39;t convince me.
    </p>
    <h3 id="47">47</h3>
    <p>
      From gambling and randomness to actual tactics. It took a while but with
      <strong>Tower Tactics 2</strong> we finally see the slay the spire map.
      Was missing it not gonna lie. This is a tower defense roguelike.
      <br />
      Gain towers and upgrades as you go through the different fights along the
      path. It has the basic towers you would expect from a game like this.
      Towers can always be freely moved which is quite nice. Besides towers you
      can also get spells to use on the waves or buff your towers. Both spells
      and towers are kept as cards in a deck you build up over the battles.
      Three towers of the same kind make a stronger one. This can be repeated
      twice.
      <br />
      It&#39;s quite fun but it has nothing that is revolutionary or wows me.
      Well... a good cake is still a cake at the end of the day.
    </p>
    <h3 id="48">48</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>This Ain&#39;t Even Poker, Ya Joker</strong> opens up with a
      clown. No not after clicking start, after booting the thing up, before the
      menu even. He traps you in the circus and you can&#39;t leave until you
      make one billion.
      <br />
      Oh so this is an auto clicker. Didn&#39;t expect that to be honest. Buy
      cards and flip them to get money depending on the matches you revealed.
      Like pairs, full house, straights, etc. You know the drill. As upgrades
      you can buy more cards, more rows, faster flips, auto flips, higher
      bonuses and the like. It&#39;s like the usual auto clicker. Make more
      money to buy upgrades to make more money. Graph must go up.
      <br />
      The fun part about this one are the explorations you unlock after a while.
      With them you can find new cards for a specific row&#39;s deck. There are
      cards that represent multiple others and some that give big multipliers
      like in balatro. I can see these decks going crazy later as you can also
      go on different explorations to remove cards from the deck.
      <br />
      Game is polished and fun. Got stuck in the circus much longer than I
      intended to. It&#39;s just addicting to flip the cards and to see them get
      flipped. What can you do.

    <p>
      Save me from slop <strong>Maid of Salvation</strong>. Okay this is as the
      title suggest a maid game. Weird I know but hear me out. This is a top
      down metroidvania crossed over with souls like.
      <br />
      There are a lot of mechanics and each screen you pass they explain another
      one. There&#39;s rolling, abilities, lock on, parry, stamina management,
      stats, souls (they call it karma), skill tree and much more. It even has
      the bloodborne style gun reload. All of it is here and the gameplay feels
      smooth and polished. I had more fun than expected. Good work devs, but why
      the maids and why are they so ugly? I mean at least make them top tier if
      you are already going down that route.
    </p>
    <h3 id="50">50</h3>
    <p>
      Blown away from the last demo by the <strong>Everwind</strong>. In this
      game valheim meets... minecraft? And it works? This is a classic survival
      game but with minecraft blocks. They went full circle. Gather stuff to
      craft and fight monsters but everything is blocky. There is much more
      detail than in minecraft however. In fact the graphics are really good.
      Take a look at the screenshots on the steam page, it looks nice despite
      the blocks.
      <br />
      Besides blocks there are also flying islands and airships you can build
      out of blocks and move around. There once was a minecraft mod like this,
      but still cool to see it as a main feature in a game. Besides those
      aspects there also seems to be a bit of a main quest that acts as a
      tutorial and gives you a goal. Game is neat but could probably use a bit
      more optimization and polish in some places.
      <br />
      They are cooking however. This rocks or rather blocks. I don&#39;t know.
      Also somehow this has a touch of skyrim. Call Todd.

    <h3 id="51">51</h3>
    <p>
      Finally some good farming? Yes in <strong>Starsand Island</strong>.
      Another copy of stardew valley but this time we are in 3D. It has all you
      want, farming, crafting, villager, quests and the like. Graphics are very
      cute. Everything looks so nice.
      <br />
      Game seems quite polished from what I could experience but I didn&#39;t
      play much. At least it has more love put into it than the other farming
      games I tried so far. Could be a bit better optimized though, I noticed
      some stutters when stuff loaded in. It&#39;s damn cute.
    </p>
    <h3 id="52">52</h3>
    <p>
      From cute girls doing farm work to the <strong>Skull Horde</strong>.
      Summon a horde of boners to fight flesh monsters in this action roguelike.
      If you hire three boners of the same type your boner gets stronger. You
      can also find items to improve your boners. Should all your boners die you
      take dmg yourself so you always have to have at least one boner up. The
      pixel art in this is top tier, especially the level changing animation.
      Gameplay is also fun and the items seem interesting. Liked.
    </p>
    <h3 id="53">53</h3>
    <p>
      You know it&#39;s something when the demo starts compiling shaders for a
      few minutes. Oh no. <strong>Painkiller</strong>, a big game? It&#39;s a
      doom like. Slay demons for some angel in hell. There&#39;s gore. There are
      weapons like in doom. Actually, this is a lot like doom. It even has the
      green skulls you punch to open doors. I don&#39;t know if doom took
      inspiration from this or it&#39;s the other way around. Gameplay seems
      smooth enough but it&#39;s a coop type of game. Play with two others to
      slay the demons. Could be fun, but I wont explore further as it
      wouldn&#39;t be the intended way to go solo and I don&#39;t want to try it
      with randoms. Maybe some streamer will play this so you can take a further
      look.
      <br />
      Update after watching some streamer play this: It&#39;s awful.
    </p>
    <h3 id="54">54</h3>
    <p>
      A big one washing up next: <strong>Tides of Tomorrow</strong>. Let&#39;s
      see what all the buzz about this one is about. Launch the game, no shaders
      this time. Game is in borderless too. Chefskiss devs. It&#39;s an, as they
      call it, asynchronous adventure. You can follow a different player
      (preferably a friend) and their choices will impact your game. I pick some
      random guy.
      <br />
      The setting of this is honestly amazing. It&#39;s set in a apocalyptic
      future where everything is polluted with plastic. The ocean has mountains
      of the stuff swimming around in it and the plastic has developed into a
      fatal sickness which demise can only be delayed with a substance called
      ozen. You play as a tideborn, a person coming out of that ocean of trash
      and which can see visions of other realities and other tideborns. Those
      are the choices the other player you are following made.
      <br />
      For example in my playthrough I had to sneak into the village as everyone
      was on high alert as the person I followed stole an ozen shipment from the
      big boss and distributed it along the people. If I had followed a
      different person it might have been a more welcoming and bright city.
      <br />
      The async gimmick is a novel idea and I hope it has these big choices all
      through the game. If this game is good or not will mostly depend on
      whether the story is good. I did however notice that the optimization of
      this demo could have been a bit better. Interesting. I&#39;ll certainly
      check the reviews after this one is out.
    </p>
    <h3 id="55">55</h3>
    <p>
      Dropping in and dragging down the list is <strong>Dead Weight</strong>.
      This is an into the breach (ITB) like.
      <br />
      Do you even know what ITB is? It&#39;s a turn based strategy game. Move
      your units and launch certain attacks on a tiled map. The game is all
      about moving in a way that the enemies who queue up attacks and execute
      them the next turn won&#39;t hit you. In this one you are not fighting
      aliens attacking earth like in ITB but here you are fighting goblins who
      captured a friend. Setting is airpunk, so flying ships and islands.
      Pushing goblins off the ship is a very important mechanics, maybe
      that&#39;s where they got the name from.
      <br />
      I have to admit after a while this one gets a bit boring as the movement
      is limited to only one tile. There is however a bunch of meta progression
      that could improve that later. The battles are quite long and difficult
      with many enemies. Due to the low movement and resulting few choices you
      got each round the fun was very limited. The pixel art is amazing though.
      Good work artists.
    </p>
    <h3 id="56">56</h3>
    <p>
      No kings they say. But what about this <strong>Crown of Greed</strong>? A
      strategy game like they are billions, only you can&#39;t directly control
      your units. Start the game, start the campaign, start the first mission.
      Click the castle. A blue dialog appears: &quot;This is the castle
      pane&quot;. Click it away: &quot;Test 1&quot; And then: &quot;Test 2&quot;
      Polished.
      <br />
      As you have no controls over your units you only create buildings and hire
      heroes. You can upgrade them but they do what they want. Some linger
      around, others go out and kill the undead to level. A few just die because
      they want to get out of this demo. You can give them potions and equipment
      to make them stronger.
      <br />
      The only control you got over them is through banners which you can place
      for them to gather or attack. But that would be too easy now would it? You
      also have to put a bounty on the banners for them to care.
      <br />
      You get gold through your buildings and after spending the initial gold
      you only get more of it slowly. Maybe I build too much and hired too many
      heroes? Whatever, next.
    </p>
    <h3 id="57">57</h3>
    <p>
      How generic of a name is <strong>Ember and Blade</strong>? Another shader
      compile. This is an vampire survivor like crossed over with hades. But
      wait, this one isn&#39;t too bad.
      <br />
      But first the game opens up with it&#39;s own trailer. Really? I&#39;m
      already here to play, I don&#39;t need to see the trailer again. Just let
      me play.
      <br />
      Finally get into the game and start playing. Oh my. All the buff givers
      seem to be scantly dressed ladies. Wait nvm this one is a fat dude with a
      guitar.
      <br />
      Quality of the game is good. The main character is a demon hunter who sees
      a woman and ignores his original quest for which he was initially called.
      Kind of a dork.
      <br />
      The upgrades you get from killing enemies are super over the top. Like
      screen wide explosion over the top. It&#39;s also quite active as you have
      an attack, dodge and ability. Besides the fighting it also has a home camp
      like Hades does. There you have characters to talk to, meta progression,
      different weapons, all the good stuff.
      <br />
      I do one run that gets all the way to the first big boss. I don&#39;t
      quite know how you are supposed to fight and dodge his attacks as the
      entire screen explodes and you have no idea what&#39;s even going on. The
      dialogue also starts to become grating after a while, but perhaps
      that&#39;s just personal preference. Overall I can&#39;t say it&#39;s a
      bad game, but not something I will explore further. While the graphics are
      good everything in this is... bright?
    </p>
    <h3 id="58">58</h3>
    <p>
      Oh a demo for THE CUBE. Save me from bad demos. So without further
      stalling lets check out <strong>THE CUBE, SAVE US</strong>. Load in and
      get to the character creator. Oh tits what is this. Select character and
      get thrown into a lobby. The tutorial is just a screen with all the mapped
      buttons highlighted. Too bad that almost the entire keyboard is used for
      something, no way I&#39;ll remember all of this. Whatever. Look around the
      hub and wait a moment... Is this gooner bait? Look around a bit more and
      see the different outfits and... let&#39;s just say I am certifying this
      as gooner bait.
      <br />
      Hop in a match and the game is an extraction like. Find stuff and get out.
      The cubes are different areas that get closed in a battle royal style.
      Each cube has unique terrain. Neat enough terrain concept but the gameplay
      feels god awful. You have a weapon and can attack zombies by clicking the
      left mouse button. This is close to Alt+F4 bad. All the money for boobies
      but the real game is this sluggish and bland?
      <br />
      I run around the hub to check if really everything is slutty and yes.
      Everything is slutty. Even the random NPCs. How could this be?
      <br />
      I open steam to take a closer look until I finally understand. This
      isn&#39;t the game I was looking for. I wanted to test the &quot;The
      cube&quot; by mundfish, the atomic heart devs. This however is &quot;The
      cube, save us&quot; by some random studio that has never released a game.
      They have another in the pipeline that also got giga delayed. Seems like
      this is some Chinese scam? Steam discussions are quite angry too. I would
      rate my experience boobies/10.
    </p>
    <h3 id="59">59</h3>
    <p>
      Hold my beer while I head into <strong>Hold the Mine</strong>. Game has no
      borderless fullscreen. Sad, as one orange would say.
      <br />
      Gameplay loop consists out of telling your dwarf which tiles to mine
      during the day. You can find resources, free heroes, and excavate caverns
      to create structures. The buildings give different buffs or act as
      defensive towers together with the heroes. Three turns of digging until
      the time of day shifts. At night your heroes automatically defend the mine
      like a tower defense. You need to survive until help arrives, which is
      like one week or a bit more, I didn&#39;t count. Could this be a
      roguelike? It&#39;s pretty basic and boring so I take my leave. This is no
      mine. It&#39;s a tomb.
    </p>
    <h3 id="60">60</h3>
    <p>
      The last call of duty number seventy three was quite bad so let&#39;s take
      a look at <strong>SealChain: Call of Blood</strong> instead. Another
      roguelike crossed with vampire survivors but in this the upgrades are
      items with sockets on the side. Combine the items into a chain to create a
      build and combos.
      <br />
      The idea is cool but nothing is explained and the item descriptions
      don&#39;t really help either. Puzzle some items together into a chain and
      suddenly you get three arrows instead of one but I have no idea why. A
      little tutorial would be nice.
      <br />
      The menu controls are weird. You have to press the button first and then
      the key. Why did the devs add so much text to everything but no proper
      explanations? Weird.
      <br />
      It also has the slay the spire type map where you go from battle to
      battle. Each battle has a clear condition and if you don&#39;t match it
      you get less loot and death appears to chase you around but if you still
      beat the clear condition with him around you can still continue. Quite
      neat.
      <br />
      Game could be cool once you understand what&#39;s going on. Maybe taking a
      look at this again in the future. Not sure.

      <strong>Master of Command</strong> is up next. A strategy game with a
      million of menus and lots of choices. You fighting a war as a commander in
      the 18th century and manage your troops. The menus are drawn and in a bit
      of a weird style. In contrast the battles are in 3D and a complete copy of
      the total war series. It&#39;s a weird break of styles. They didn&#39;t
      even copy the total war correctly, the battle mechanics are terrible and
      troops do things you don&#39;t want them to do.
      <br />
      Question: Why not play one of the total wars? This one has a weird feeling
      and is super boring to me. There is however probably an audience for this
      somehow, somewhere. Far away from me however.

      Back to rubicon? Ah no... It&#39;s only <strong>Robicon</strong>. A tower
      defense. Build towers on a little 3x3 grid and you can move them around
      freely. Two of the same make a stronger one. Enemies attack from all
      sides. After every round you get to pick new towers. Sometimes you can
      also expand your little base. A shop appears from time to time and offers
      more towers. The graphics are very simple, rectangles in different shapes
      and colors. Overall this is just bland. There is no seasoning.

      Let&#39;s get cooking in <strong>Goblin Sushi</strong>. No we are not
      cooking goblins, the chef is a goblin. And to no one&#39;s surprise this
      is a game about said chef cooking. In fact you are playing as that goblin.
      <br />
      You own a little sushi stand and have to cook for your customers. Click
      ingredients in the right quantities to finish different recipes. Each
      completed meal gives you XP from which you get, surprise surprise,
      upgrades for your little stand once you level up. There are upgrades for
      existing recipes, new ones, bonus money multipliers, a bonus for specific
      ingredient arrangements, faster refill of ingredients, more storage and
      more.
      <br />
      The game is surprisingly fun. Every few minutes your landlord shows up to
      collect the rent. Like the other meals the rent money wanders over the
      conveyor belt and it&#39;s funny seeing the stack of money get bigger and
      bigger as the landlord wants more each round. I was almost ready to quit
      when a boss showed up. His little minions all want to be fed and it&#39;s
      a nice change of pace for the end of the run. Game was really fun but I
      don&#39;t think this will be as fun in additional runs.

      It may be time for the <strong>Last Mage</strong>, but not for the last
      demo. This game is dark and scruffy. A world dark and full of fear. Exile
      and depths. Start the game and get blasted by a weird upbeat rocky OST.
      This doesn&#39;t fit the atmosphere at all.
      <br />
      Game itself is... drumroll... a vampire survivors clone. I swear man, you
      can&#39;t get away from them. Dread it, run from it, VS will arrive all
      the same.
      <br />
      This has the usual mechanics you would expect but there are two
      interesting parts. First, when picking a skill those three skills can also
      have up to three potential paths. So in total you could get up to nine
      choices. Neat. Second, the meta progression are items you have to puzzle
      into your backpack, like backpack battles. You get them from the boss
      chests that appear in the levels and the items get kept between runs, so
      you can build up a powerful inventory. Also neat.
      <br />
      Not much to call out here except the weird music and the mid graphics.
      Don&#39;t think it&#39;s too bad.

      Next we visit <strong>Kotama and Academy Citadel</strong>. A metroidvania
      where you play as a cute anime girl in an academy of science. You have the
      usual abilities, fight enemies, solve puzzles, encounter bosses, etc.
      About what you would expect from a game like this. The graphics are
      amazing. Everything looks very pretty and it&#39;s not even made with
      pixel graphics as these games usually are.
      <br />
      Negative is that everything feels just a tad bit floaty. Especially if you
      compare it to something like which silksong which feels much more grippy.
      Hey at least this one has cute anime vibes.

      like that and it is. Game is about what it says on the tin. Similar to
      that other pointless game about digging a hole in your garden, only in
      this one you are digging through a big dumb. Put the trash into the bag
      and sell it to gain money from which you can buy upgrades like more
      stamina or bag size. There are also some valuables in the pile that you
      can sell at a different point for more money than a bag of trash. Despite
      only playing this for a few minutes I already saw each one of the
      valuables at least three times, so there isn&#39;t any variety of what you

      After the rapture we get <strong>Revelation of Decay</strong>. Start the
      game and witness it&#39;s in Chinese. Luckily I can use my menu kong-fu to
      select English and start the game. The game describes how bizarre matter
      has turned living beings into bizarre monsters. So yeah, it&#39;s a zombie
      survival game.
      <br />
      View is top down with good looking pixel graphics. You can loot, craft and
      the like. It&#39;s not bad, but very confusing. There&#39;s just so much
      going on. I&#39;m supposed to collect wood, berries and herbs but I manage
      to go the wrong way and get teleported into some subspace. There are giant
      monsters and then the entire world goes white? There is a giant cat then a
      tree with eyes. It feels like a trip, but not a bad one.
      <br />
      Every time you attack an enemy the player character says &quot;Endless
      killing is why I exist.&quot; and it&#39;s honestly a vibe. Maybe a bit
      too self aware. I think the game is good, perhaps a bit confusing to get
      into.

      Shipwrecked from the craziness of the last demo I arrive to
      <strong>Oceaneers</strong> where you manage three stranded survivors. A
      survival-crafting colony simulator as you would call it.
      <br />
      Wrecked with their raft on a small island you have to manage the three
      directly. Tell them what to do, crafting, salvaging, hunting, building and
      whatever else. It&#39;s fun as you can select each one of them and shift
      queue jobs for them to do much different to how these game usually go,
      where you just tell them a job needs to be done and have no direct control
      over them.
      <br />
      There is also some future tech laying around so there are possibilities
      for some cool building and crafts down the line. You can also see sharks
      circling the island in the south, so combat will also be a part. I like
      it, good spin on the genre by the devs.

      Let&#39;s take a look at
      <strong>A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad</strong>. Oh surprise it&#39;s
      one of those ragebait games. Only up but this time you don&#39;t control a
      character but the flippers of a pinball course. Apparently you have been
      turned into the ball and have to get to the end of the course to turn back
      or some shit.
      <br />
      Game has the expected witty narrator that&#39;s oh so funny. Not. I really
      hate these. The game opens with a screen showing the languages and he
      tells you to select the option that fits, which won&#39;t be the first one
      if you don&#39;t understand him as it&#39;s English. Haha good one. This
      is a game to watch someone else play and not something to be played.
      Suggest it to your favorite person to see them have fun.

      Pick one word for something dark like abyss, night or whatever and add a
      quantifier for a group behind it like horde, swarm or army and you got a
      perfect template for a vampire survivors clone. That said I&#39;m
      conflicted on <strong>Night Swarm</strong>. This is a game where you have
      to protect the castle as the new vampire lord. The character model
      isn&#39;t animated but a figurine model that hops around. Probably easier
      to animate but I think it&#39;s more of a stylistic choice.
      <br />
      Gameplay is, as I said, a vampire survivors like. You get the slay the
      spire like map of multiple battles where you collect the VS like upgrades.
      The maps are like in ravenwatch, multiple points of interest with
      different effects and upgrades.
      <br />
      At first I think it&#39;s pretty basic as you can only get two abilities
      but as you move along the map you can also get companions that have one
      ability baked in and a free slot for another that you choose. The idea is
      pretty good.
      <br />
      And the OST is amazing. I probably let the main menu run longer than the
      game itself. Conflicted if I really like it or only a little bit.

      As <strong>Extinction Day</strong> is here, maybe the rapture wasn&#39;t
      fake after all. In this doomsday simulator you have the job to eliminate
      humanity. Like in Plague Inc. you can deploy a virus to do the job or you
      can also choose from other global disasters like storms, tornados,
      earthquakes, meteors, parasites, volcanoes, zombies or even war. Most of
      these disasters can be spread across the globe and upgraded in various
      ways. There are also abilities to influence the people, like healthcare
      collapse, misinformation or fake news. Extinction is the goal so nothing
      is off limit.
      <br />
      Wait some of those abilities sound quite familiar to the real life? The
      tutorial starts the run in north america, another coincidence. It really
      is particular.
      <br />
      There are two types of disasters, active and passive. The passives are
      those that automatically spread and the active ones you can use like
      spells at specific places. No more Madagaskar last stand like in Plague
      Inc. It&#39;s pretty fun.

      Combating the last game we got
      <strong>Pixel Survivors: Defense</strong> as the next one. Boot it up and
      the game is in German. Open up the menu to change the language and see
      that it&#39;s already English. Weird. Swap the language to Chinese and
      back to English does it. I do however wonder how often language is an
      issue in these demos. Maybe I should do a counter next time. It&#39;s so
      vital for success, spent some time to get it right.
      <br />
      At first I think it&#39;s just another vampire survivor like but surprise
      surprise it&#39;s actually a tower defense as your character can&#39;t
      move. Enemies appear from the right side of the screen and run towards
      you. They do drop XP in the form of blue gems that you collect with your
      mouse. Each level you can upgrade either your character or add another
      character up to a limit of six to create a full team. It&#39;s quite fun
      as there are also gold drops and a shop that sells risk of rain type items
      after each wave.
      <br />
      The game is fun but quite short. Needs more content and upgrades for the
      little guys in the party that are more than just dmg or more projectiles.
      Have seen much worse though.

      Called itself tiny but is actually a big hit. Sliding in next is
      <strong>Tiny Auto Knights</strong>. An auto battler quite similar to super
      auto pets but from a different dev. You buy knights and place them on a
      3x3 battlefield to battle other players arrangement of knights. Each
      knight has different abilities and effects. There are a lot. Some
      examples: Buffing newly bought knights, resurrecting others, poisoning the
      enemy, freezing, buffing others, and many more. The game is packed with
      combos and builds and has simple but cute pixel graphics. I really like
      this one, it&#39;s fun, unique and polished. Thumbs up.
    </p>
    <h3 id="74">74</h3>
    <p>
      The next in the queue is <strong>Vindilis</strong>. In the menu the game
      tells you that it was made by a solo dev, so props for that. The style is
      amazing. A cool drawn style in a dim red and it works amazingly.
      <br />
      It&#39;s a 2D side view souls like. Too bad that the controls of this
      suck. Everything is sluggish. After making an input you can&#39;t do
      another. For example an attack locks you in place for way longer than it
      should and it results in the game being unfun. Combat needs to feel fluid,
      the limit shouldn&#39;t be your movement but your skill.
      <br />
      This one definitively needs longer to cook. Still impressive work for one
      guy art wise.

      <strong>Million Depth</strong> starts on a spaceship. You dive down to
      earth and jump into the million depth. Haha get it, that&#39;s the name...
      <br />
      In this you clear different rooms to jump deeper into the unknown depth.
      Big part about this game is crafting your weapon. You can design it freely
      out of blocks and it will deal more dmg the more corners and pointy ends
      it has. Enemies also take dmg if you run into them for some reason.
      <br />
      Unfortunately the game has a weird jump where you can&#39;t move during
      it. That one really bothers me. Makes the whole experience feel
      unresponsive and sluggish.
      <br />
      The pixel art style is nice and the roguelike element of taking one of
      three ways down is not too bad. I like the weapon concept and can imagine
      that it give a lot of possibilities with different block combinations but
      the rest feels a bit too unpolished to invest more time into it. And
      please fix the jumping.

      This is the last Vampire Survivors like. For real, for real.
      <strong>Momento Pole</strong>. It&#39;s also the worst of the ones I tried
      this time. No joke.
      <br />
      It&#39;s pole based for some reason? Like actual metal poles on which you
      swing around. Certainly unique, I give them that. You start the game by
      picking a random ability out of the classic three offered choices. I pick
      one at random because I don&#39;t really care. The yellow one. Bad idea.
      The one I picked requires you to swing around three poles in a triangle to
      create a damage zone. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me or if this is
      just way too hard. Spinning around a pole gives you quite the momentum and
      landing on two different poles for the perfect triangle seems impossible.
      With no damage ability I die before killing a single enemy. Worlds first?
      <br />
      Garbage.

      No, not the pokemon koffing, <strong>Kofoin - Swarm Defense</strong> is
      the next one on the list. I start the game and the tutorial and see a
      message &quot;Welcome to Kofin tutorial.
      &commat;missing_input_mapping&commat; to continue&quot; Haha nice one
      devs, not binding the button to continue the tutorial is a new one.
      Settings menu also has no control rebinds which makes this even more
      perfect. There is however a checkbox to skip the tutorial, saved I guess.
      <br />
      Finally into the game I see that it&#39;s a tower defense. You control the
      bees of a hive. Send them out to flower patches on a hexagonal tile map to
      collect pollen. Use pollen to create more bees or discover more terrain.
      Ant spawners appear on random tiles and after a global timer finishes they
      each spawn a wave of ants as enemies. Defeated ants give XP and upon level
      up you can choose an upgrade for your hive, bees or towers.
      <br />
      I tried it a few times but I can never get enough bees to not die after a
      few waves. Game is way too hard or I am doing something wrong. A tutorial
      would have been nice.

      The constant stream of demos is nearing it&#39;s end, but first we are
      jumping through <strong>Constance</strong>. A metroidvania that reminds me
      of silksong. Like a lot. The art is clean and so is the movement for once.
      You play as a painter girl exploring this world. I didn&#39;t quite get
      the story but maybe it got skipped for the demo. Each ability, like a dash
      makes you spent your paint. Spend all and you become corrupted. In this
      state every move that would normally use paint now uses your HP. A cool
      concept.
      <br />
      The puzzles and jumping aren&#39;t easy. This certainly has some potential
      but it really is quite silksong coded. NPCs even have the funny noises
      like they do in the hollow knight games. And the art in this is also top
      tier. Props to the devs, they might be cooking.

    <h3 id="79">79</h3>
    <p>
      Hide, hide, we are entering <strong>Rubinite</strong>. Game starts with an
      amazing opening cinematic. That alone is worth a look. It&#39;s pixel art,
      but near perfection.
      <br />
      The story is about little ruby who is running away from the villain and
      hiding until she can take revenge. It starts of by having you walk along a
      path of blood with arms reaching out of the abyss to the sides. At the end
      is a big eye which looks upon you, from it falls a drop of blood on ruby
      that gives her some power I think? The villain is a witch who wants rubyâs
      eyes.
      <br />
      Cinema.
      <br />
      It&#39;s a boss rush game. No filler, only the meat. You can attack and
      dodge. Pretty simple but besides that you can also observe the enemy to
      charge up a special attack. There are three levels that can be charged but
      getting hit once means you lose all of them. Doing a perfect dodge will
      also get you a level. Yes just yes. It feels amazing to play.
      <br />
      If possible you should try this demo for yourself, I loved it. Perfect
      art, atmosphere, blood, gore, all of it. This is a wishlist and probably a
      buy for me.

      Going topside with <strong>Arc Raiders</strong> next. Heard a lot about
      this so let&#39;s take the opportunity and check it out first hand.
      <br />
      For anyone that doesn&#39;t know, this is an extraction shooter. Meaning
      you go out into an area to find loot and then get back out to keep that
      loot. If you die, you lose everything. PVPVE, so you are up against real
      players and NPCs. The NPC faction you fight against in this one are called
      ARC and consist out of robots like drones and walkers. Some big, some
      small, some tiny. You can play solo and be matched against other solo
      players or play in a team up to three people. I&#39;ll try it solo, so I
      can only imagine how fun it has to be with a team of friends. Besides the
      matches there is also meta progression in between the matches, like
      unlocking new crafting recipes or getting upgrades and skills.
      <br />
      First about the game itself, it&#39;s polished. Even the menu buttons feel
      good to hover, a tiny detail but it makes a complete picture. Especially
      the audio in this seems good. It really makes you alert or surprised you
      at times with how accurate it is. Honestly the whole atmosphere is just
      great. Really impressed with it all. Now let&#39;s get some insights into
      some rounds I played. Overall the fun can be quite varied, so I&#39;ll
      only mention some highlights. There are certainly some rounds where you
      just die and lose all of your stuff, but that comes with the genre.
      <br />
      In my very first game I spawn in and see a NPC drone. I try killing it and
      end up dead. Seems like NPCs are no joke in this.
      <br />
      Load up another run and this time I&#39;m avoiding the NPCs like the
      plague. Instead I&#39;m looting some stuff until I see another player.
      Carefully sneaking after them I wait for the perfect moment to jump them.
      A few bullets and a run around the rock he is hiding behind and victory is
      mine. Get some good loot and make it to the extraction point and get out
      before making contact with another human being. Success.
      <br />
      In the last run I did much later it was night and after some really close
      calls with the robots that are more threatening than during the day I make
      it to the extraction with like three other survivors. Great fun.
      <br />
      The other attempts were quite varied. In some I can extract with a bit of
      loot in others I just die. One had a really long fight and NPC disasters
      but in the end I died and lost it all. I even found some blueprint for a
      new weapon but died and lost it.
      <br />
      Overall I have to say I enjoyed this one much more than I had anticipated.
      I might buy this. Anyone wanna team up and head topside?

      A bonus flip for <strong>Q-UP</strong>. The game starts up and clearly
      outs itself as a meme game. There is a cinematic about Q-Up being the
      future of e-sports. Everything will be decided by randomness so it will be
      perfectly fair.
      <br />
      Before you can play you have to adjust some settings. First you have to
      adjust the slider so that the middle one of three digit strings is
      completely random. Next up are the input settings. There is mouse
      sensitivity, whale sensitivity and dev sensitivity. The terms of service
      can&#39;t be accepted easily because the accept button is running away.
      Finally done with the settings you get to pick one of three characters,
      each with unique abilities. I decide to go for the medic. Time to queue up
      or should I say: Q-UP?
      <br />
      The game starts, and it looks like it&#39;s against real players or at
      least the game uses names that make it seem like real players. Gameplay
      mechanics are quite easy. One team is Q and the other is UP. A coin with a
      Q and UP side get&#39;s tossed, which side lands up gets a point. It&#39;s
      a best of five, so first to three Ws also wins the game. With these
      mechanics in place you&#39;ll certainly have no ranked anxiety in this
      one.

      After the game you get into the main screen of the game. It&#39;s actually
      a kind of auto clicker. You can get skills and items to gain more elo
      despite losing or winning the coin tosses. Skills can be leveled and
      arranged on a hexagonal board in a way that they continue to trigger a lot
      of times. The items also give multipliers or flat points to your score per
      flip. Between each game you get a new mail, either with a new tutorial or
      a meme content. Honestly after finishing the whole demo it seems to be a
      fun clicker game. There are so many memes in here, das crazy. I like it.

      PS: It kinda simulates how Forsen plays League Of Legends.

      So many games there will certainly be something for everyone in here. Some
      of my personal highlights this time around were these:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Teamfight Manager 2</strong>, manage your own MOBA team to
        success
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Sentence</strong>, type faster than everyone else in this
        battle typer royale
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Checkmage</strong>, perfect mix of chess and fun mechanics
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>KORRIDOR</strong>, there is a corridor and demons to be killed,
        get to it
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Constance</strong>, beautiful metroidvania that reminds me of
        silksong
      </li>
      <li><strong>Rubinite</strong>, a boss rush with amazing style</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arc Raiders</strong>, an extraction shooter that&#39;s worth
        checking out for once?
      </li>
      <li><strong>Q-UP</strong>, the future of e-sports, don&#39;t miss it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Honorable mentions this time around were,
      <strong>Deepest Well</strong>, <strong>Skull Horde</strong> and
      <strong>Night Swarm</strong>. They might turn out great but still need a
      bit of work before they can be released.
    </p>
    <p>
      This next fest was great fun for me and I hope I could show you some
      interesting new games or at least you had fun reading this.
