  <h1 id="joy-of-demos">July - Joy of Demos</h1>
  <p>
    I really didn&#39;t expect to do another review so soon, but seeing
    Steam&#39;s updates to demo handling made me check out the demo hub and
    gather another bunch of them for testing. Nothing special this time,
    it&#39;s a list of things I found laying on the floor, lonely, nobody else
    wanting to pick them up. These demos looked interesting enough for me to
    waste some time on. So lets begin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tl;dr can be found at the bottom as always. But you wouldn&#39;t dare to
    skip all these hilarious reviews. Right? RIGHT?
  </p>
  <h2 id="demos">Demos</h2>
  <p>
    For some reason most of the demos I could find looked like tower defense
    games. Is this because the last things I checked out were strategy games and
    this is close to it? Is this curated to appeal to my &#39;interests&#39;?
    Well, we will see if the holy algorithm is right or if it does not scratch
    my mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    First game this time will be <strong>Goblington</strong>. This demo review
    starts off... horrible. This game is literally the same as
    <em>Super Fantasy Kingdom</em>. Remember it? Automatic city builder type
    game, heroes defeat monsters at night. This game is the same thing. No wait-
    you don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s literally the same. Down to the bone.
    Everything except the graphics. Huh? Same Systems, hell even the way the
    heroes go to the tavern at night to level up is the same. Copy game? Really
    weird.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pest Apocalypse</strong> is another giant steaming pile of garbage.
    You drive a truck, pick up pizza&#39;s and deliver them. Actually it&#39;s a
    vampire survivor like. So each pizza delivered you get upgrades. But
    problems are many. First the game is fucking lagging like crazy. Graphics
    are nice and all but maybe first get your game to actually run? Second, to
    drive you have to hold RT on controller. You guys really want me to hold RT
    for the entire fucking run? Are you guys stupid?
  </p>
  <p>
    Next game opens on the wrong monitor borderless window but not even full
    screen. Wow getting it to run on my main screen is hard, hm? Anyways lets
    check out <strong>Rift Riff</strong>. It is a tower defense. You get thrown
    into a late game scenario, no clue whats going on, your base explodes and
    then the real game starts. I&#39;m digging the style. Game appears to be
    more a puzzle than a tower defense with how close each wave is. Mechanics
    are a bit weird, to build a tower you have to walk your character to the
    spot, then hold space, select the tower with w and hold a or d then release
    space but keep holding the other button to built it. Couldn&#39;t this have
    been done better? Got used to it after a bit but still meh. Meh game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up: <strong>Tavern Keeper üçª</strong>. No the emoji isn&#39;t my spin
    on the title. It&#39;s actually there in my steam lib, emoji and all. You
    already know it&#39;s gonna be a good one. The art style is cute. The
    opening scene if funny, a big tavern brawl. Game starts, and shows a big
    hobbit tavern. Cozy and Comfy. Comzy even. The tutorial is quirky in a
    really good way. You manage a tavern, serving drinks, buy booze, you get it.
    You can even adjust every prop inside the cavern however you want. Limitless
    possibilities! Demo is three in game days only and I finished them all.
    Would like to play more. Wishlisted. Going to keep an eye on this one.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Seedborne Soldiers</strong> Made with the Godot engine, cool. The
    game itself? Not so cool. This is auto chess. Or rather teamfight tactics
    with the hexagon style board. Why is it called seedborne? Because for some
    reason the units are growing? Idk man, it&#39;s just a fucking list and you
    click them. Hexagon? More like hexa-gone if you catch what I&#39;m putting
    down, because I&#39;m not interested in this at all. However it is funny
    that they abbreviated Assassin into Ass.
  </p>
  <p>
    You like tetris? Well, I do but I hate <strong>Tower of Nod</strong>. In
    this game you control a little guy having to jump up the afore mentioned
    tower. However you can press a button to fall asleep and control the tetris
    pieces falling from above to create a tower you can jump up. You have a deck
    of blocks that keep falling down, Slay the Spire style. Only problem is,
    this isn&#39;t fun. Like not at all. Building a tower and moving the guy at
    the same time is just to disorienting to result in enjoyable gameplay.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cubic Defender</strong> starts on the opening screen with &quot;tap
    to play&quot;. Mobile game? Yep it is. You can&#39;t even move the camera
    with WASD, no you have to click and drag with the mouse. Come one guys,
    really? The game itself is a very simple tower defense. Even the demo has
    some sort of ingame store? You can&#39;t even exit the game because it
    doesn&#39;t have a quit button. MOBILE GAME TRASH. Be ashamed devs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Omg it&#39;s the funny frog and soyjak and cat and it&#39;s called
    <strong>Meme Mayhem</strong>. The player characters are me, emoji boy,
    strong doge, gaven, chad, sad toad(pepe) and mars?(I guess this is supposed
    to be space karen). You are thinking of a meme? This probably has it. The
    game is a turn based auto battler vampire survivors? Hard to describe. You
    hurl emoji&#39;s at trolls on twitter and battle, automatically. Then you
    pick perks and relics to improve your emojis. I can see this going really
    crazy. Seems like a lot of fun, might buy it if not too expensive.
    Wishlisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Did you ever ask yourself how tetris would play if each tetris piece would
    fall apart like sand and you had to get the correct color in a row to clear
    a row? Well that is what <strong>Sandtrix</strong> is doing. And let me tell
    you, some things should remain a question and not become reality. Fun for a
    few minutes, then boring as hell.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>MistsBook</strong> is a kind of Balatro-Like. Instead of poker cards
    you have unique decks with special effects. Get big combo to reach the next
    level. Buy new special things between each level. Well it&#39;s like
    Balatro. But kind of missing the special something. Kind of bland and boring
    even though they tried to copy another popular game. Shocker, really.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>WARCANA</strong> is a mix out of base building, tower defense and
    deckbuilder. You draw cards to build your base and spawn units to attack
    enemy base. And it&#39;s not just one or two units. Its a hundred plus.
    There is multiple thousands running around. Game seems fun but a bit dry,
    maybe it gets more interesting later? Could see myself playing this if
    it&#39;s just a few bucks. Apparently it also has online: battle-royale? I
    have no idea how that will work out, similar to autochess I suppose. Could
    be fun, will wishlist.
  </p>
  <p>
    First WARCANA now <strong>ARSONATE</strong>. Stop screaming at me plz. This
    game is like that one where you have a turn based shotgun shootout with
    another guy. Here we are flipping cards on a board and get random things to
    either flip or unflip other cards. A bit meh, board seems way to big; for
    your choices to matter it will take a while. A bit too slow for it to be
    fun. Also each utility you find has a cut scene you have to watch once you
    use it. Gets a bit repetitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Who Wears The Crown?</strong> More like who copies Jump King? This
    is jump king but you are a chess piece jumping up chess boards? Unlike in
    jump king you can overcharge your jump which makes you fail and fart. Yes,
    literally. Hate this. Trash.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>Dice Dice Dice</strong> you actually roll four dice not three.
    Lies! Some random combo game where you pick tiles to get big combos from
    your dice rolls. Probably has some big combos but it doesn&#39;t interest me
    much. Sorry devs, not even really looking at your game here, it&#39;s too
    boring for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tower Factory</strong>, will this be a factorio clone? It says
    Factory on the tin so it&#39;s factory on the inside. Tower defense
    factorio. Build harvesters and crafters to gather materials for towers.
    Pretty basic stuff. Could be fun but then again like always, why
    wouldn&#39;t I be playing factorio instead? Factorio clears. Factorio,
    Factorio, play Factorio 2.0!
  </p>
  <h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    Even while picking up some random demos outside an event, I found some neat
    ones. The ones I would recommend looking at are Tavern Keeper üçª (and
    don&#39;t forget about the emoji) and Meme Mayhem. I also kind of liked
    WARCANA but I think that&#39;s just personal interest in a game idea like
    this.
  </p>
  <p>Cheers your local demo enjoyer.</p>
