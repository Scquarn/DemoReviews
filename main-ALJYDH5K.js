Simply walking to the right pixel to target the tile in front of you to use your tool on it is torture. Oh and btw, every time you move the entire screen flickers a bit.

You are attacking from ranged but can only turn by moving. This way you always end up walking into enemies. In addition your basic ability is also moving you forwards?

A wizard, to setup your settings, in a game. Do they have such little faith in todays gamers? Then again look at certain streamers. Actually a good idea, I want to change my mind.

I will most likely take a look once the game comes out, because this and Gothic 2 are two of my favorite games of all time.
