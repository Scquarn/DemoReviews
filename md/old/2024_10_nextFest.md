# Title

Hello and welcome to the October Next Fest. As usual we are taking a look at a random assortment of demos. As you know, the word demo is a shorthand for demonstration. There are also political demonstrations, which in Germany we also simply call demonstrations or demos for short. So what I'm trying to say is this: I want to demo this shit. Holy shit most of these are bad this time.

Tl;dr at the bottom as always.

## Demos

In **Worshippers of Cthulhu** you create a cult and manage it in an Anno-like style. On paper it sounds good, but the performance is so horrible that I stopped playing after a few minutes. Tutorial tells you to click and dismantle a shipwreck. You click the shipwreck and nothing happens. There is no menu or anything appearing. Solving this took the entire five minutes. Even now, I still have no clue why or how it suddenly worked. Game is rough and unfinished even for a demo. If you put out such a bad product as a demo I unfortunately don't have the faith for the real release to be any better. Game has been removed from my wishlist, too. Major L.

Next "Game" is **Fantasy Map Simulator**. This Software creates a random map with random countries that go to war with each other. You can influence them a bit, but this is mostly only a "Watch the simulation do it's thing" game. Similar to a screen saver. Meh.

**Frontline Crisis: Demo** is a very simple tower defense game where you control a Mech, build buildings that collect resources, and shoot the enemies, who are big bugs. Not complicated but fun. Neat little game, but very basic.

**Royal Revolt Warriors**. Vampire Survivors Clone. Looks like a mobile game. That's it. That's all you managed to develop. Not even worth writing more about.

Behave yourself because, **The King is Watching**. This is an interesting game. You build tiles on the left of the game, like fields and mines to gather resources and barracks to train units. On the right your units fight against the approaching enemies in an auto battler style. The game is really slow and a boring. Neat idea, but needs to be faster to be engaging.

Next up is **Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel**. Surprise guys, this is another Vampire Survivors Clone. This one's special selling point is that it looks neat. The graphics make it look like diablo 4, so quite nice. Yeah that's about it though.

Lets move on to **Seed of heroes**. What could it be? Say it with me: Vampire. Survivors. Clone. But you recruit other units who do the attacking automatically for you. Yay I guess?

**D.O.T Defence**. You might not believe me but this is indeed not a Vampire Survivors Clone. Omg an actual game, these do exist. Game itself is like an auto battler. You own islands from which troops spawn. You can tell the troops to move in a general direction and attack the enemy islands. To support your troops you can also build towers and other stuff. If you capture all islands you win. Unfortunately the gameplay not a lot of fun for me.

**Elite Exorcist Miko**. What is this? If you guessed "Hololive bullet hell shoot'em up" you were right. Lol. The gameplay includes classic twin stick shooter mechanics and in addition switching between three modes with different attacks. Everything is a bit complicated and feels clunky. Maybe I'm simply not zoomer enough for all the bullets and hotswapping, abilities, timeslowdonws, etc. happening at the same time.

**Star Vaders**. Yes, yes, yes! This is it. The devs are not only cooking they are deep frying. In this little gem of a game you control a little Mech through a deck of cards that you are building. Think slay the spire but with a chess board on which you can play movement cards and move your little Mech. Deckbuilding, Card upgrading, Artifact collecting. It has it all. The music is a bop. The art style is cute. The mechanic of playing cards and generating heat which limits the amount of cards you can play is well designed. This is a hit. Already whishlisted and looking forward to it! Check it out.

**Munch** ado about nothing. You play as some sort of demon, eating stuff to evolve into a bigger demon. Kinda a Vampire Survivors like, but very active, has player abilities and all of that stuff. Art style is nice but gameplay feels a bit boring and repetitive. Music has nice riffs tho.

Next we are fighting hordes of enemies in **Voin**. You got a sword, you are slashing up minions. The style is a bit weird to me. I feel a bit lost in this game. Where to go. What to do. What's the point? Not really understanding this one. Also the insane headbobbing is giving me motion sickness.

Do you know Temtem? Well there is now also **Temtem: Swarm**. What is Temtem? It's Pokemon, but every battle is a team battle. That means a 2v2. That's why it's called temtem. Smart right? Oh, you want to know about Temtem: Swarm? It's another Vampire Survivor clone, but you control a temtem and can not only find abilities but also evolve if you level enough. Drink one for every temtem I said.

**First Break** of Vampire survivors. Good spooky atmo. This is looks like one of those old 2D pixel rpg games at first but all it really is about, is solving rooms. Each room you need to get a key while things charge at you. You can shoot to budge them away. A little bit. You know the devs are funny when the death counter has four digits. This isn't fun for me. An Action-Puzzle horror.

**Tinkerlands** looks like a top down terraria like. Reminds me of Core Keeper and Necesse. Both great games I already own but haven't finished. So I won't look at this one further until I finished the others. Neat game though. Made by only 4 devs too. Good job!

Did you ever wonder how much further AI will develop? Well there is an **AI LIMIT**. A dark souls clone in anime style. Game loads for like 10minutes. Holy lack of optimization. Gameplay feels neat, has all the common dark souls things you would expect. From Bonfire to Firekeeper and classic Miyazaki tomfoolery by placing enemies behind corners. Not an awful clone.

**Stirnova** launches a launcher where I have to login. Nope. Quick look at twitch to see what this is about: Tactical Anime shooter, Valorant style. But here's the catch: you can turn from 3d into 2d. LoL. Lmao even. You should check the trailer to understand what I mean. What a trip. Interesting.

Fuck it we ball. Literally. In **Ballionaire** you create a pachinko with special bouncers the ball can hit and earn money to reach an increasing higher score. There seem to be a bunch of interesting combinations and effects. For me it's a bit too random to be fun. Not a bad game though.

**Warside** is an Adventure wars clone. Clean and simple turn based strategy. Me like, but there is already Wargroove so I would play that instead.

**Journey to Incrementalia** is a cookie clicker type game. You are an skeleton overlord destroying walls. Yeah literally. There is 100 walls you need to break through by gathering mana and raising skeletons. Really slow and boring.

Did you ever hear about slay the spire? **Commander Quest** is slay the spire but instead of playing cards to attack enemies you play cards to summon units that auto battle. This game is amazing. The classic Artifacts, Cards, Shops, Map, Bonfire, Upgrades, etc are all in this. Really fun game. Wishlisted.

I like ants, so lets check out **Empire of the Ants**. You control a single ant and can order six groups of other ants around. Game is pretty basic, each ant hill you own has some basic upgrades and can create a single group of other ants. There is no cool base building or other stuff. Pretty meh. But hey ants.

**Everwarder** is a tower defense game. You place crystals to mine darkness for resources which in return spawns enemies you have to destroy. Cute pixel graphics and neat clear gameplay. A good little tower defense to try out. Wishlisted.

**The Spirit of the Samurai** is an ori like. You play as a samurai. It has clean graphics and decent combat. But feels a bit off to me. For example jumping has an impact as if you were Godzilla himself. The game asks you to play with controller but the menu doesn't work with controller. Sound balancing is way off. Needs more work. Game itself could be ok.

## TL;DR

What a huge pile of garbage. The two good ones are **Star Vaders** and Commander Quest. Amazing, wishlisted and looking forward to them. Maybe Everwarder is also worth a look if you want to play a little tower defense.

Cheers your local Mech Pilot.
