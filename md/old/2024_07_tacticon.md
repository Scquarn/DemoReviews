# Tacticon July

Tacticon? What is tacticon you ask? Why not ask who is tacticon. Or rather why is tacticon? Anyways it's a third-party thing on steam, covering a bunch of strategy games, some of them with demos, so lets check them out as usual. Every game will be given a fair chance and yada yada. Lets fall into this strategy chasm and I hope these won't have me re-read the art of war.

Tl;dr at the bottom as always. Just like last time, you see the pattern here? It's a format. A recipe you might say. I'm cooking here. (Literally it's warm)

## Demos

Even with me trying to gather everything interesting my demo-trained eyes could gaze upon, I only got eighteen demos this time. So it's not a lot, but quality over quantity right? These are also some of the games recycled over and over again in game shows, so let's finally take a closer look at them.

Starting this whole thing off with the game on my wishlist that got me to notice this whole event in the first place: **Cataclismo**. I tried the story and let me say: Boring as fuck. Running around with one unit searching some lady? Nah let's hop into a skirmish to see some action and Oh-My-God. This is basically They are Billions (TAB), like literally, but you get to build your base with blocks, minecraft style. This could be epic. I however died on my first monster wave, because I am a bit clueless. Seems good, stays on wishlist for now. Might try more of the demo later.

The next one is... **Backpack Hero**. What you ask? Isn't this just backpack battles? Well, yes. Yes it is. It's the OG one. Don't ask me why it's here but lets check it out. I quickly notice that it isn't like backpack battles at all. Yes you have an backpack and yes you need to sort your items but it has a slay the spire type gameplay. Items also don't auto activate but you have to choose which you want to activate based on a turn based energy system. Pretty neat, but yeah I would rather play the other game...

**Songs of Silence**. So this looks pretty nice, like visually I mean. It's like total war, but the battles are auto battles and your heroes have cards that can be used to activate abilities in battle. Feels pretty nice to play. Why is it suddenly 1 am? I played this for much longer than I wanted to.

From Milady to **Milord**. And omg, like huh? This is totally not it baby. Oh mah gawd. What the fuck is this. First off the game places you as a lord to handle requests of the citizens where you either say accept or deny or whatever. But what brainfucked dev thought these voice effects were good? It's hideous. Dreadfull even. An idiot sandwitch for my ears. Also in the first four requests I had the same one twice? Are you dumb or bad game? Let me take the role of the lord one more time to give you a game review: DENY!

After that previous pile of shit can **Liftlands** lift me back up? No. It's kind of an afk game where stuff happens and you watch it. Get little dudes building your village, click stuff and collect it for them. Painfully slow. Painfully boring. Pain for everyone involved.

Final Fantasy, uh no actually this is **Final Factory**. Factory? Like Factorio you might ask? Well yes. Yes it is. This is factorio but in space. You have to built a space station factory. Gather materials from asteroids and chug them into the conveyor belts. Seems to have a bit more of a initial learning curve than factorio with your factory also having to balance stability and heat. Could be fun, but I think I'll just go for factorio 2.0 instead. Not a bad game however!

**Tactical Breach Wizards**, hell yeah brother. Xcom type game. Except your are a wizard harry. A wizard with a wand gun. I cast gun, or some say freedom. You know it, haha so funny. Not really my type of game. Turn based and stuff. Meh.

What is **Dungeon Clawler**? It is like Peglin. There explained it for you... What you don't know Peglin either? Well then let me explain you Peglin first, it is a combination of Peggle and Slay the Spire. There! Now you get it right? What no? Anyways... Clawler is Slay the Spire combined with a classic arcade claw game. Grab things with a claw and get them. Kind of a neat idea but I'm missing the fun here. The whole first stage I was just clawing the same items each time until enemies were dead. Where is the crazyness of a rougelike coming in? Not seeing it, sorry devs: boring.

**Microtopia**. Robot-Ant-Colony-Simulator. You heard that right. You create ants from metal, set up routes and wait a fucking second. This is a factorio-like again isn't it? Don't develop something like that when factorio 2.0 is around the corner. Okay, next.

**The Deadly Path** is a auto clicker type game. You uncover cards and place servants to gather stuff to click more tiles and place more servants. Fun for a bit but then you ask yourself why? Why am I clicking this. Why am I even doing this? What's the purpose of this? Of Anything? Aren't all games just mindless clicking in the end? What's good and what's bad clicking? I don't know. This isn't my type of clicking lets end it with that.

A vision told me the next game would be **Seer's Gambit**. A game that opens in a small window and can't be maximized by clicking on the topbar, so let's head into the options. There is a dropdown menu to change the resolution but it's so fucking tiny I can't read anything at all. A few random presses later the game is big, so here we go. The game itself? It's good. Awesome job devs. You gather a rag tag group of heroes, each with different abilities and categories to create synergies. It's an auto battler, but each hero has an active ability you can use at when it is best. Positioning also matters. Heroes can even be leveled. No clue if it's a rougelike or what happens if you lose, but so far it's fun.

Will I find more iron ants in **Ironhive**? No, not at all. This is a game where you built a city, turn based. You draw cards which you use to gain resources and built things. Literally The Deadly Path from before but now it's turnbased. Still not my kind of stuff, sorry.

**Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess** the weird capcom game seen again and again at the game shows. So, what the hell is this really, let me check it out. The game is a kind of tower defense. Cleanse corruption, assign villagers to roles and help the priestess Yoshiro cleanse the enemies gate. The game is actually a lot of fun, I finished the entire demo and still want to keep playing. Which is rare! Full price might be a bit much but I'm definitely picking this one up on a sale! Added to wishlist.

A bit of a fake Demo review, because I own this game: **Empires of the Undergrowth**. Yes more ants. However in my opinion this one is a good one. It reminds me of the old sim ant game, grow your ant colony and watch them skitter about. Love it and I should play it again!

Is it just me or are there a lot of crab games lately? Is it like in real life where the crab lifeform is the ultimate state of being? Evolution always ends in a crab. There is so many species that have kept evolving only to end up becoming a crap. Extinct crabs just evolve into being again from other species. Crabs are him. Is it the same for games? Anyway, lets dive into **Crab God**. You open the game and are greeted by a statistic of the real world impact this game had. Sea Tutrles saved, trees planted, ocean plastic cleaned, etc? Yo this is sweet. It is a cozy managment type of game. You manage a little crab tribe trying to hatch a new god. Each level you need to gather enough food to proceed to the next. It's fun and comfy. Would buy if on big sale. Wishlisted.

**Shogun Showdown** is the child of Slay the Spire and Into the Breach in a 2D plane. What the fuck were the devs cooking with this one. It is amazing. Graphic is great, the deckbuilding is great, the music is great, the strategy is great. The tutorial alone sold me on this game. Fucking amazing. Bought.

A demo fest always needs at least one big demo. Big as in filesize big. This time it's **Tempest Rising**. 15gb total. Game starts and what am I watching? Cutscenes galore, movie time. Literally this is why its so big. The game itself? This is like the older C&C games. A classic RTS game. Feels okay. If you want to play something like that, this might be worth a try. But please download this demo and tell me if you also think the cutscenes and vibe is somehow really weird.

Cinema last. Time to try out **Hollywood Animal**. A typical tycoon type game. Manage a Hollywood studio. Seems to have it all. From scriptwriting to production, distribution, etc. Random event pop up you have to manage. The game had a start up warning about Hollywood being evil and it being included in the game and yep they did. We got the whole thing, from stealing pay to racists, all of it. Could be a cool management game, but honestly it is a bit overwhelming. There is like a gazillion buildings and tech trees and things you have to do. Investing more time would probably make this game worth the while however.

## TL;DR

Tacticon surprised me. This time there are a few big hits. These are Shogun Showdown, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Cataclismo, Crab God and Seer's Gambit in that order. If you don't check out Shogun Showdown as a rougelike enjoyer that's a big loss for you.

Cheers your local tactician.
